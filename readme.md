1. The attached zip contains following folders/files :  
    Models [contains 4 .py files and 2 .ipynb files]
    Dataset[contains training (data_train.csv) and testing (data_test.csv) files]
    Report

2. All six algorithms are in a seperate code file.
    1. SVM.ipynb : SVM alone with various kernels.
    2. randomForest.py: Use of random forests with varying tree depth and no. of trees.
    3. logistic.py: Use of Logistic regression with various solvers
    4. KNN.ipynb:  Use of k Nearest Neighbors Algorithm with varying the number of neighbors.
    5. CNN.py: Use of Convolutional Neural Network
    6. CAE+SVM: Used Convolutional AutoEncoder and results fed into SVM

 To run any of these, put the code and the dataset in same folder and run through any standard IDE. Use Jupyter Notebook for .ipynb files.

3. Report consists of gist of all the work done under the project and thus includes all the results obtained while using various algorithms and the graphs/figures plotted/obtained in the process.

4. I have not uploaded the dataset on github.
